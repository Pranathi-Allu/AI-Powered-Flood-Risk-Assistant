# AI-Powered-Flood-Risk-Assistant

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **AI & ML learning journey**.  
The goal is to build an **AI-powered assistant** that helps assess and manage **flood risk** by analyzing multiple datasets such as precipitation, elevation, river networks, and population exposure.

## 📂 Datasets
The datasets used in this project include:
- 🌧️ Precipitation data (GPM IMERG)  
- 🏔️ Elevation data  
- 🗺️ Administrative boundaries (GADM)  
- 🌊 River network data (HydroRIVERS)  
- 👥 Population distribution data  

📥 All datasets are available on **Kaggle** (beacuse all the datasets which I used are too large):

## ⚙️ Features
- Load and preprocess geospatial datasets (GeoJSON, Shapefile, GeoPackage, TIFF, TXT).  
- Perform **data exploration** using Pandas & GeoPandas.  
- Check for **missing values** and perform statistical summaries.  
- Foundation for building an **AI-powered risk assistant**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas / GeoPandas**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**  
- **Rasterio** (for raster datasets)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
